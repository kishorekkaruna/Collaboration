		of optimizing sometimes even unseen possibilities. Stephen M. R. Covey

		Problem solving skills have nothing to do with luck. Too often people
		who view the success of an individual or organization from outside
		looking in do not see the work that went into moving the yardsticks
		forward or in designing a new approach to a business model or in
		persevering when thousands of others would have given in and quit.
		Byron Pulsifer, Problem Solving Skills - Luck "It is impossible for
		you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are
		mutually exclusive and you always have the power to choose either."
		Marge Powers, Anger: What's Up With That? - Laughter To develop

		about inspiring and enabling others to do their absolute best together
		to realize a meaningful and rewarding shared purpose." George B.
		Bradt; Jayme A. Check; John A Lawler, The New Leader's 100-Day Action
		Plan - Purpose "If you persuade yourself that you can do a certain
		thing, provided this thing be possible, you will do it, however
		difficult it may be. If, on the contrary, you imagine that you cannot
		do the simplest thing in the world, it is impossible for you to do it,
		and molehills become for you unscalable mountains." Emile Cou√© -
		Believe In Yourself When you ask these successful and accomplished
		individuals about their turning points and listen carefully, you will
		often hear truly enlightening and inspirational stories -stories that
		can serve as a shining beacon of light to us all. Bernie Swain, What
		Made Me Who I Am - Inspirational Stories We begin doing things because
		of a motive; we continue doing them because of both motive and habit;
		but there may come a time when motive is forgotten and we continue on
		because of established habit. Andrew Carnegie - Habit When we take on

		But, the main point to remember is that there are actions that can
		bring you closer to whatever end goal you have in mind and then there
		are actions which simply waste time without moving your game plan
		forward." Catherine Pulsifer, Action Plan Template - Time "When
		dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures
		of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures
		bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity." Dale
		Carnegie - Motivation We have learned that "more" is not necessarily

		that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems . . .
		we must simply do our best. Jimmy Carter, Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a
		President - Problem As adults we have an obligation to guide our
		children and to encourage them to read books that will improve their
		lives and inspire them to excel in life. Dr. Marshall Hennington,

		times. Dealing positively with these obstacles is what makes the
		difference between them turning into worse states or being overcome."
